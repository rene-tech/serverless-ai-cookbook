# Scientific AI Apps

Use the `scientific-ai-apps` MCP server (or its configured name in another
client). `bionemo-models` is a retired LibreChat alias, not the product name.
Authentication is supplied by the configured client, not a skill file;
never ask for, print, copy, or place an API key in tool arguments. The caller's
key determines the visible Apps and owns the resulting operations and artifacts.

## Discover before invoking

1. For discovery, call compact `workbench_list_apps` once with `{}`. It returns
   the complete authorized catalog without filters. For a domain question select
   the relevant returned group; do not enumerate domains through keyword retries.
   `workbench_search_apps` is a separate literal phrase search: zero matches do
   not mean zero permissions. For a named App, read its schema directly. Legacy `list_models` and
   `list_scientific_models` remain fallbacks when the workbench helper is absent.
   Compare their `tool_catalog_revision`; refresh tools when it changes.
2. Call `get_model_schema` with the selected public `model_id` and protocol.
3. Use the returned `contracts[].tool_name`, flat `input_schema`, examples,
   source references and active-runtime identity. Independent Apps using the
   same underlying model remain separate Apps.
4. Prefer that named typed tool. Do not infer fields from a model's name, an
   NVIDIA REST example, or an old skill. Re-discover after an authorization,
   missing-tool, or stale-schema error.

Named serving tools accept the model fields directly plus optional
`idempotency_key` and `wait_seconds`; named scientific tools accept the
scientific run fields directly plus optional `idempotency_key`. Do not wrap new
calls in `payload` or `request`. Do not send `model` to a named OpenAI-chat tool:
the App already selects it. The generic `invoke_model` and
`submit_scientific_run` envelopes are compatibility routes for model-agnostic
clients, not the default for a skill-directed call.

If this skill disagrees with the tool's current schema, the tool schema wins.
Do not silently omit unsupported scientific inputs or switch models. Explain the
specific incompatibility and ask the user to choose a supported workflow.

## Submit once and resume

- Create one stable idempotency key of 8–200 characters per logical submission.
  Reuse it only with the identical payload after an uncertain transport failure.
  A corrected or deliberately new request gets a new key.
- Set serving `wait_seconds` to `0` unless a short bounded wait materially helps.
  Submission returns a durable operation/status record, not the final prediction.
- Save and report the operation ID. Prefer `workbench_get_operation` for bounded
  waiting and `workbench_get_operation_result` for verified file-backed results;
  fall back to gateway lifecycle tools if the workbench helpers are absent.
- Scientific submissions return an operation plus batch state. Poll
  `get_scientific_status` and incrementally read `list_scientific_events`.
  Wait for result publication, then call `get_scientific_result` and retrieve
  the returned artifacts. Execution success alone may precede publication.
- Treat `queued`, `activating`, and `running` as nonterminal, not proof of
  advancing execution or a specific capacity problem. Do not resubmit or
  cancel because a chat/tool timeout elapsed. Terminal states are `succeeded`,
  `failed`, `cancelled`, `preempted`, and `expired`.
- Download and verify outputs before `acknowledge_operation`; acknowledgement
  purges an ordinary retained payload/result.

## Scientific artifacts

For a non-LibreChat client, read [portable client setup](references/portable-client.md).
LibreChat-specific workspace and executor tools are optional client capabilities,
not part of the hosted model MCP. Keep the same model contracts in either client.

The workbench has an authenticated Workspace upload/download panel and verified
file helpers. Ordinary chat attachments still are not automatically gateway
artifacts. The connected `visualize_structure` tool renders real coordinates
from completed native inline or bounded JSON-artifact results; it does not
resolve arbitrary scientific-batch artifact collections. Signed handles and
bearer tokens stay outside model context. Never promise an unsupported bridge.

Chat attachments and local paths are not gateway artifacts. For every input:

1. Read the actual caller-owned bytes outside the language-model context.
2. Compute exact SHA-256, byte count, media type and compression.
3. Let the installed trusted file helper call `begin_model_artifact_upload`,
   transfer through its handle/HTTPS content path and finalize. Scientific
   begin/finalize names remain aliases; raw byte tools are not agent-visible.
4. Build a canonical manifest from the returned immutable artifact references;
   upload and finalize that manifest too.
5. Submit the named scientific tool with the finalized manifest reference.

Never invent or reuse another user's artifact ID. Keep base64 values and
structure/media files out of chat. Use returned upload/download handles or
the HTTPS artifact path through the trusted file helper. Check handle expiry.

For a native artifact input use `/opt/bionemo/upload-artifact.py`; this uploads
one exact local file but does not create a scientific input manifest or run a
model. For scientific batch use the installed existing
`/opt/scientific-client/bin/python /opt/bionemo/invoke-scientific-batch.py --help`.
It handles a source file, canonical manifest, named submission, resumable receipt
and hash-verified downloads. Read model schema and input provenance to select
its arguments; do not implement an improvised uploader in chat. Use one stable
output directory/idempotency key and resume it after a bounded wait. Inspect all
promised output artifacts and scientific constraints; transport verification is
not scientific validation.

Read the **top-level** `get_model_schema.input_artifact_contract` for exact
source entry name, semantic type, media type and compression. An `entry` is a
fixed source role; `operations` selects a role by the published operation;
`source_kinds` selects by the source kind. Do not use a filename/run ID as the
entry name or invent a semantic type from a model name. The source media type
describes its actual bytes (such as `application/json`); the helper creates the
outer `application/vnd.fs2.scientific-manifest+json` artifact separately. Missing
contract metadata is not permission to guess. Keep rejected receipts unchanged;
an explicitly corrected request has new metadata/identity and must not replace
an accepted or unknown admission.

For sequential native, batch or mixed multi-App work use the packaged
`/opt/scientific-client/bin/python /opt/bionemo/scientific-workflow.py --help`.
It delegates to the existing clients and advances only after a verified
terminal receipt and saved result. Native steps set `kind: native` and provide
`id`, `model`, absolute `input` and `output` paths, and `idempotency_key`;
`output` is the existing native receipt directory. Batch steps retain the
existing batch-client fields. A short wait returning queued/running is not completion and
must not trigger the next stage. The immutable plan and each step keep the
original output directory and idempotency key; a known concurrency rejection
waits visibly, while ambiguous admission or application failure stops for
inspection. A long-running execution job can wait until terminal without tying
up a chat turn; retain its execution ID. Run directly through the durable
executor, not shell backgrounding/nohup or chmod on the Object Storage mount.
Native speech calls consume concurrency too; do not submit them all in parallel
when the caller policy allows only one active operation. Do not change keys to evade a rejected
or unknown admission. Optional `/v1/me` describes caller policy, not real-time
reserved capacity.

## Errors and user-facing results

- MCP `-32602` with `data.type: model_input_validation` means no work was
  admitted. Use each issue's JSON-pointer `field`, `rule`, and any
  `missing_fields`, `allowed_fields`, or `expected` details to fix the input.
- For 401/403 or a missing App, check this user's key and current catalog. Never
  substitute an admin credential or claim academic eligibility in the request.
- For 429, retryable 503, or an interrupted submission, retain the same
  idempotency identity, back off, and check the saved operation.
- For a terminal model failure, report the public model/App, operation ID,
  timestamps and returned structured error. Do not label acceptance as success.
- Raw serving results may be the result body or a legacy `{operation, result}`
  envelope. Large serving results use `operation-artifact-result/v1`; the
  workbench resolver saves verified full JSON and returns compact metadata.
  Scientific
  results are versioned run documents whose output manifests point to artifacts.
  Preserve structured fields and verify artifact hashes rather than pasting raw
  files into the answer.

Model access is authorization, not a license grant or biological/clinical
validation. Describe outputs as model predictions. Do not invent snapshot,
replica, priority, or GPU controls in model payloads; those are platform settings.

Read [the complete client contract](references/client-contract.md) for transport
limits, scopes, retention, scientific-file details, and known BioNeMo differences.
