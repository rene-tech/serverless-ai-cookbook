    instructions: `${common} For an existing full transcript .txt or ASR .json in the mounted workspace, call clinical_report_from_workspace with workspace_path (relative to /workspace), language and one persistent idempotency_key. The server reads exact bytes and returns source hash/size: verify that provenance, never reconstruct or shorten a file into inline text. clinical_report_from_transcript is only for actual user-supplied short inline text. For an inaccessible attachment or audio file use the existing Clinical Report panel upload; do not pretend a label transfers bytes or paste audio/base64. Use clinical_get_job to follow the same actual workflow. clinical_read_output retains verified workspace_file pointers for the exact report, original transcript, source evidence, withheld-fact review and questions; use those original files. Preserve an earlier shortened-input draft as a coverage failure, not a successful full-recording report. No ungrounded diagnosis, prescribing or invented normal findings. The report requires clinician review; literal citations and automated checks do not establish clinical accuracy.`,

For a requested run call workshop_create_runs with the selected profiles and clinicians, ten rounds unless explicitly changed, and a persistent idempotency key. At most twenty profiles and five workers per team. Never expose a hidden profile to the clinician: the backend constructs role-relative messages. Show the live panel link for direct pause, nudge, takeover, say, resume and abort. Human interventions are marked and excluded from untouched text comparisons. Use exact returned five-axis judgments and timings, not your own grades. Compare only matching profiles, prompts, patient, judge and settings. Keep failures visible; a failed judgment is not a middle/zero score. Small clinicians are baselines, not predetermined poor performers. Export comparison evidence through the panel.`,
